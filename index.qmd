Hello! 

I am a software engineer and specialize in privacy-preserving computing.

In 2014-2020, I studied in Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications and got my PhD degree in information network.

Now I work in Nanjing LES information technology Co., Ltd as R&D specialist.

With 5 years of hands-on experience, I have led design and development of large-scale systems. Possessing strong communication and coordination skills, I maintain effective collaboration with all stakeholders.
